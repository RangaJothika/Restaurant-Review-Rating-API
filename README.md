# Restaurant-Review-Rating-API
Built a Spring Boot REST API to manage restaurants, customers, and ratings. Implemented endpoints to fetch restaurant visitors, filter customers by rating thresholds, and calculate average restaurant ratings using Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, JPQL, and native SQL. Tested with Postman.
